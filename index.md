title: Student Developer team Project
---
# Overview

The purpose of this is to gather a group of the smartest student developers at Victoria University of Wellington and combine everyoneâ€™s individual talents towards a project that will hopefully have a meaningful impact on the university and/or those in the surrounding community.

Should you be accepted, you will gain invaluable experience working in a team on a project that you will see from concept to deployment. You will be given charge of a large, specialized part of the project of your choosing which you will see done to the best of your ability. This is not only an excellent opportunity to decorate your CV, but should the product be built, deployed and marketed correctly; there is a chance for monetization and therefore a share in profit.

Students must not have too many commitments and will be willing to commit a decent amount of time weekly to the project. We are mainly looking for students in their first or second year due to availability, however if you are in your third year or beyond and believe your studies and work commitments will not hinder your ability to contribute, then please get in contact.
